# CertificateReminder_PaloAlto

This program allows you to generate calls in the form of e-mails to prevent the GlobalProtect certificates of "PaloAlto" branded firewalls from expiring. 
The program is based on XML configuration files provided by the firewalls. An HTML file is then generated and sent to the relevant users.
